Ingredients

    1 lb chicken breasts diced
    1 medium onion chopped
    1 large potato peeled and diced
    1 cup water
    1 small bunch parsley (about 1.5 cups, chopped, loosely packed)
    8 large eggs
    6 oz cheese
    2 tbsp olive oil

Spice Blend

    1 tsp cumin
    1 tsp coriander
    1 tsp turmeric
    1 tsp salt
    1/2 tsp paprika or cayenne pepper if you want some heat
    1/2 tsp black pepper
    1/4 tsp caraway
    1/4 tsp thyme
    1/4 tsp cinnamon

Directions

    Mix the spices together (grinding any whole spices if necessary) and set them aside.
    In a large frying pan or pot over medium heat, saute the onions in about 1 tbsp of olive oil until tender.
    Toss chicken with 1/2 of the spice mix. Add this to the pan and brown.
    Add the potatoes and the water to the pan. Bring to a gentle simmer, then cook uncovered until potatoes are tender and most of the liquid has evaporated.
    Stir chopped parsley into the cooked mixture and set aside to cool.
    Preheat oven to 350¬∞F (180¬∞C), and grease a medium (2 quart/liter) baking pan with the remaining olive oil.
    Thoroughly whisk the eggs in a large bowl, then mix in the cheese. Stir in the chicken, potato, and parsley mixture, along with the remaining spice mixture. Stir until well-combined, then pour into the oiled baking dish.
    Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until set in the center. Allow to cool, and serve warm or at room temperature. Serve with some harissa, if you like.
